            <p style="text-align: center;">Group 3 consists of three dedicated members, each playing a crucial role in the development process. 
                One member focuses on front-end development, ensuring that the user interface is visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive. 
                The back-end developer is responsible for managing the server-side logic, databases, and ensuring seamless data flow between the client and server. 
                The third member handles script writing, bringing interactivity to the website through well-structured and efficient code. 
                Together, these roles complement each other, enabling the team to build dynamic and functional web applications.</p>
