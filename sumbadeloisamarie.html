                    <p style="text-align: center;">My full name is Eloisa Marie Mendoza Sumbad. I currently study in
                        Bataan Peninsula State University's Main Campus.
                        I am also under the Computer Science Program, Major in Software Development and a third year
                        student. People sometimes
                        mistake me as someone living in Bataan, but I'm actually from Olongapo City, specifically
                        Barangay New Cabalan. I was
                        born on October 28, 2004 and ever since then I've lived in Olongapo City</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> In our home, we actually have almost all of our whole extended
                        family in my mother's side
                        iving in a compound lot. I have tons of cousins here that I'm close with, but almost all of them
                        are still in high
                        school, making me the eldest out of all my cousins here. However, between me and my parents, I'm
                        actually their only
                        child, and my parents have been long separated. I've been living with my mother and her family
                        since I was four years
                        old, while I sometimes visit my father in Bataan, where his hometown lies. My whole childhood
                        though,
                        it was my grandmother that raised my even until now, and has been my second mother my whole
                        life.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">When I was a child and was already in elementary, my father gave me a
                        dog stuffed toy that
                        I named Rosebud, which made me want to have my own dog. Now, I take care of four cats that lives
                        in our house.
                        One of them is Shanghai, which is originally owned by my mother, but when Shanghai got pregnant,
                        my mother gave the
                        cat's children to me including their Shanghai. From then on, I raised all four of them and the
                        three children I
                        named with Gray, Fishcake, and Ice. Every single day, I give them food and water and even clean
                        up their mess and poop
                        to keep their area clean.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">About my interests though, I've always been into animations,
                        fictional literature,
                        games and art. Even when I was a kid, i always loved drawing, and now I still am and I keep
                        striving to improve my
                        skill. These interests also what got me into taking this course. Although I hesitated to take
                        Computer Science because
                        of Entertainment and Multimedia Communications due to my interests of drawing, I decided on my
                        chosen course because of
                        how there's more opportunities out there for me. I was nervous at first since I knew nothing
                        about programming. But,
                        now as a third year student, I've been enjoying it so far despite the difficulties of facing
                        issues and errors when
                        creating programs, especially midterms and finals</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> Summarizing everything I put in here, I'm a third-year Computer
                        Science student majoring
                        in Software Development at Bataan Peninsula State University Main Campus despite actually being
                        from Olongapo City,
                        not Bataan. I live with my extended family on my mother's side in a compound, and though I have
                        many younger
                        cousins, I am an only child, with my parents having separated when I was four. Raised primarily
                        by my grandmother,
                        I have a close bond with her four cats, whom I take care of daily. My childhood love for drawing
                        and animation
                        sparked an interest in fictional literature, games, and art, leading me to consider
                        Entertainment and Multimedia
                        Communications. However, I chose Computer Science for broader career opportunities, and while
                        initially hesitant
                        about programming, I now enjoys the challenges it brings.</p>
