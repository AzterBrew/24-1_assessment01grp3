                    <p style="text-align: center;">I’m Francheska Rae S. Sison, born on August 24, 2004, and I live in
                        Balanga City, Bataan.
                        Currently, I’m a third-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program,
                        specializing in Software
                        Development at Bataan Peninsula State University - Main Campus. I have a strong passion for
                        coding and love exploring
                        new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and collaborating with
                        my classmates on assignments.
                        I’m eager to enhance my skills and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for music. I
                        play instruments like
                        the guitar and ukulele, and I enjoy singing as well. I also have a keen interest in exploring
                        new designs and layouts
                        that can help me improve my front-end development skills. Currently, I’m a new member of the
                        BPSU Chorale, which allows
                        me to connect with fellow music enthusiasts. Additionally, I’m involved in the SSITE (Student
                        Society on Information
                        Technology Education) and serve as the class mayor, engaging with my peers and fostering a sense
                        of community.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">In my educational journey, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
                        Computer Science,
                        with a strong focus on front-end development. I believe learning should be enjoyable while also
                        being informative.
                        I’m drawn to areas where logic meets creativity, as this combination is both challenging and
                        fulfilling.
                        My approach to life is careful and intentional, always guided by a clear purpose. By
                        understanding how computers
                        work at a fundamental level, I unlock endless opportunities for artistic innovation, and I’m
                        excited to see where
                        this knowledge will take me in my career.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> I would describe myself as calm, deep, and creative. I thrive in the
                        company of people I
                        trust and feel safe with, as it allows me to be my authentic self. Meaningful conversations that
                        delve into new ideas and
                        perspectives are my favorite, as they spark my curiosity and inspire me to think deeply. Being
                        around supportive
                        encourages me to express my creativity more freely, whether through music, art, or
                        problem-solving.
                        I truly value connections that foster authenticity and understanding, as they create a nurturing
                        environment where we
                        can all grow and learn from one another.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> To my future self, I am excited about where I’m going and eager to
                        pursue a job that
                        I truly enjoy and love, one that aligns with my chosen program. I hope to work on innovative
                        projects that challenge
                        my skills and creativity. Building a positive impact in the tech world is important to me, and I
                        want to collaborate
                        with inspiring colleagues. I envision a career that allows me to grow while contributing to
                        meaningful solutions.
                        Remember to stay curious and open-minded, as these qualities will lead you to exciting
                        opportunities and help you
                        navigate your journey. </p>
